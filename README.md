Hi, I'm Mario564, a full-stack Javascript and Typescript web developer who likes to code both as a hobby and as a profession. I mainly work with modern techonologies such as Next.js, SvelteKit, tRPC, Prisma, Drizzle ORM, Tailwind CSS, and few other tools. I also make some spreadsheets with Google Sheets.
